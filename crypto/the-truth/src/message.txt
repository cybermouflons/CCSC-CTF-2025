THE TRUTH ABOUT VIM â€“ THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW!

LISTEN UP, FELLOW TRUTH-SEEKERS. I HAVE BEEN DIGGING DEEP INTO THE SO-CALLED "VIM" EDITOR, AND WHAT I HAVE UNCOVERED IS GOING TO BLOW YOUR MIND.

VIM IS NOT A REAL TEXT EDITOR. IT NEVER WAS. IT IS A TRAP, A CAREFULLY CRAFTED ILLUSION DESIGNED TO KEEP DEVELOPERS LOCKED IN AN ENDLESS CYCLE OF TRYING TO EXIT!

THINK ABOUT IT. WHY DOES NO ONE EVER "JUST OPEN AND CLOSE" VIM? BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT. YOU GET IN, YOU PRESS SOME KEYS, AND SUDDENLY, YOU ARE TRAPPED IN AN ARCANE WORLD OF MODES, COMMANDS, AND CRYPTIC ESCAPE SEQUENCES.

COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT.

VIM WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE USED, ONLY TO CONTROL AND CONFUSE. THE SO-CALLED "TEXT EDITING" IS JUST A FRONT. BEHIND THE SCENES, WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING? PACKET INTERCEPTION? KEYLOGGING? MIND CONTROL? NO ONE KNOWS, BECAUSE NO ONE EVER SURVIVES LONG ENOUGH TO CHECK THE SOURCE CODE IN ITS ENTIRETY.

EVER WONDER WHY "VI" CAME BEFORE "VIM"? BECAUSE IT WAS THE PROTOTYPE. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE EXPERIMENT. VIM IS JUST VI MANIPULATED. A MORE ADVANCED FORM OF DIGITAL ENTRAPMENT.

THE REAL TEXT EDITOR? WE WERE NEVER MEANT TO FIND IT. THINK CRITICALLY. STAY VIGILANT. USE NANO.

WAKE UP BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
